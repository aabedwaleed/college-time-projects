This readme goes over what I have worked on in each project, some of the projects I have worked on completely on my own, and some of them were team projects so I worked on specific parts.

Anime recommendation system:
There are two recommendation systems in this project, one is collaborative and the other is content-based. I worked on the content-based part with my colleagues. We used Sklearn to get the similar animes with the tags to the anime the user has watched.

Chat application:
Me and one of my colleagues made a chat application where one user would send a message to another over wifi. The application is simple but taught us how to use threads and some local wifi related stuff.

Rock paper scissors image recognition:
This was a project I did all on my own in the summer of my second year. I used a CNN model to recognize the images and got 98% accuracy.

Storefront database and sites:
This was a team project made up of 10-15 people so my work in the project may not be as significant as the other projects, but I made the database ERD and helped with the creation of the database itself using MySQL.

Walmart sales analysis:
I worked on most of the visualization in this project and answered a couple of questions that were provided by the instructor with the codes given.
