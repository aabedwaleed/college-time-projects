Anime Recommendation System Report


Overview:
This project recommends anime based on two different models.
One of the models is content based which means it relies on similarity between animes cosin similarity was used to measure similarities and TF-IDF was used to make the evaluation matrix.


The second is collaborative based which means we use the user ratings to predict if a user is going to like an anime based on other users who rated other animes.

Implementation:
get_recommendation function which applies the content based system and takes anime name as a parameter and returns list of recommendations based on genre


find_similar_anime function which applies the collaborative system which takes the anime_id and returns a list of recommendations based on user ratings
